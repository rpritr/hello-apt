# Hello APT — Simple C++ App Packaged as a Debian `.deb` Package

**Hello APT** is a minimal example project that demonstrates:

- a simple C++ program  
- a Makefile build system  
- how to package the compiled binary into a Debian/Ubuntu `.deb` package  
- how to install the package via `apt` or `dpkg`  

This repository is intended as a learning example and a template for building your own APT-installable applications.
